# CitraKnowledgeBase
link of the website: https://citra-knowledge-base-system.herokuapp.com/Home

A system to help student find the subject(CITRA subject only) that is suitable for them according to their profile

This system is a web-based application using HTML,CSS and Javascript. 

For this project, I used Django because it easier to execute and control rather than using other type of framework where you 
need to use 2 framework to work for back-end and front-end development.
